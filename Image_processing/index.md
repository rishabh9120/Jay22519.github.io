### Our project of Automatic Answer checking is divided into 2 modules ->

 1. Converting given input image file into text file
 2. Using the text file generated to find how correcrt the given answer is

<b> This page deals with the first module . The crux of it is to use optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from handwritten answer sheet. </b>

### Overview

We are using Microsoft Azure Read API for text recognition from the uploaded document, however the accuracy of such API is not perfect so we are also using autocorrect/dictionary check as it will improve the accuracy in most cases. 

### Microsoft Azure Read Api

The [Azure Computer Vision Read API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text) is Azure's latest OCR technology that extracts printed text (in several languages), handwritten text (English only), digits, and currency symbols from images and multi-page PDF documents. It's optimized to extract text from text-heavy images and multi-page PDF documents with mixed languages. It supports detecting both printed and handwritten text in the same image or document.


### Autocorrect Module and Levenshtien Distance

The Autocorrect <sup>[1]</sup> is module that takes a string as input and it replaces the words which it thinks are mispelled . Internally it uses the concept of Levenshtein distance <sup>[2]</sup>
to find the closest matching word from the dictionary .

The [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#:~:text=Informally%2C%20the%20Levenshtein%20distance%20between,considered%20this%20distance%20in%201965.) is a number that tells you how different two strings are. The higher the number, the more different the two strings are.
For example, the Levenshtein distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is 3 since, at a minimum, 3 edits are required to change one into the other.
kitten → sitten (substitution of “s” for “k”)
sitten → sittin (substitution of “i” for “e”)
sittin → sitting (insertion of “g” at the end).
An “edit” is defined by either an insertion of a character, a deletion of a character, or a replacement of a character.

### Further problems to solve

1. Adding support for pdfs
2. Improving accuracy for keyword autocorrection
3. Differentiate among various questions
